<p>On this page, you can apply to participate in {{ conf_data["shortname"] }}. Please be sure you
    have read <a href="http://www.europeanharmonybrigade.org/">what a Harmony Brigade is</a> and
    <a href="http://www.europeanharmonybrigade.org/faq/">how we handle applications</a> before you apply.
    In particular, note that your application is complete only when you have
    paid the registration fee of € {{ conf_data["s_application_fee"] }} in full via Paypal. If your application is not accepted, we will reimburse this fee to you via Paypal as quickly
    as we can.</p>

<p>The information you submit will be held in confidence. We may share
    it among the organizing team in order to review the applications, but
    we will never give it to a third party.</p>

<p><strong>EHB sponsorship program:</strong>
    If you are a great singer and the only thing that holds you back from
    coming to {{ conf_data["shortname"] }} is the registration fee, we may be able to reduce
    or even waive your registration fee. Note that we can only offer this
    for a small number of participants, due to financial constraints.
    To apply for such support,
    please  <a href="http://www.europeanharmonybrigade.org/about/">contact an organizer</a>
    with a brief explanation of why we should consider you for
    sponsorship. Your email will be held in the utmost confidence.
